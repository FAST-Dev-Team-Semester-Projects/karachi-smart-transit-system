# Entity-Relationship Diagram

This directory contains the Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the Karachi Smart Transit System database.

## Files
- [ERD.png](ERD.png) - Visual representation of the database schema showing tables, relationships, and constraints

## Important Notes
**ERD may not be 100% aligned with the latest database state**

The ERD represents the database design at the time of creation. While efforts are made to keep it current, the authoritative source of truth is always the actual database schema defined in `../ksts_schema.sql`.

For the most accurate and up-to-date database structure, always refer to:
- [../ksts_schema.sql](../ksts_schema.sql) - The canonical database schema with all tables and relationships
- Additional database files as needed (triggers, views, migrations) for complete implementation details

## Usage
- Use this ERD for understanding the overall database architecture and relationships
- Refer to the schema files for implementation details and exact field definitions
- The ERD is primarily for educational and planning purposes
